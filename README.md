# learning-notes

Personal learning notes and daily logs.  
This repository is a place to record thoughts, learning, and experiments — focusing on continuity rather than perfection.

## 📌 Purpose

- Organize thoughts during study and work
- Build a reusable personal knowledge base

## 🗂 Structure
- `daily/`  
  Daily logs, reflections, and short notes
- `topics/`  
  Topic-based notes (technology, math, testing, etc.)
  
## 📝 Policy
- Notes may be incomplete or rough
- Some content is written primarily for myself
- Accuracy and structure will be improved gradually
  
## 🚀 Status
This repository is actively updated when time and mental space allow.
